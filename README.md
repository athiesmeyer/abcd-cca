**splitting.py**: Create, save, and load splits for cross-validation.

**make_tables.py**: Create, save, and load quantitative measures (qms), resting-state functional connectivity (rsfc), and optional confounds dataframes at each timepoint.

**processing.py**: Split all dataframes into folds according to pre-determined splits, impute missing data, and optionally regress out confounds

**main.py**: Run supported CCA algorithms. Plotting will require tailored filepath setup
